    <h3>Our Solutions</h3>
    <p>All of our contracts begin with a <strong>GAP assessment</strong> to determine the actual needs of the client.
    </p>
    <p>We find synergistic solutions to ensure you’re addressing root problems, and not the symptoms of the problems.
    </p>
    <p>We use a holistic approach to determine the current state of the project and the client’s immediate needs, as
      well as identifying other shortfalls that should be addressed in the future.</p>
